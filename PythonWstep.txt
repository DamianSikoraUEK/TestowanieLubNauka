2. Explain

A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical,
relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.
A string, for example, is a data type that is used to classify text and an integer is a data type used to classify whole numbers.

In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.
Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.
The data consists of constants or fixed values that never change and variable values (which are usually initialized to "0" or some default value because the actual values will be supplied by a program's user).
Usually, both constants and variables are defined as certain data type s. Each data type prescribes and limits the form of the data. Examples of data types include: an integer expressed as a decimal number,
or a string of text characters, usually limited in length.

In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process. For instance,
"x" is an arithmetic operator that indicates multiplication, while "&&" is a logical operator representing the logical AND function in programming.
Example: AND / OR / NOT / AND / NOT NEAR

5. debugging
Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.
To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.
